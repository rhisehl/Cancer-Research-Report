# Cancer-Research-Report
A hypothetical research project was conducted to determine if any of nine potential treatments reduced tumor size in mice. 
The mice were evenly split between male and female, and were divided up into ten treatment groups. The Capomulin and Ramicane groups had more total observed timepoints than all other groups, and they also had lower variance among tumor sizes than the other groups. It is likely that the reduced variance is due, at least in part, to the increase in timepoints observed. 

Interestingly enough, the Capomulin and Ramicane groups had noticeably lower average tumor volumes than the other measured treatment groups (all non-included treatment groups had close means and medians for tumor volume, including the placebo).
